Towny advanced is developed by ELgarL.

Unlike upstream:
- This fork drops support for all Permission/Economy providers, aside from Vault.
- This fork uses Maven for compilation.

The changes above were done quickly and without much thought. I specifically tried to avoid touching any code, it's all pretty horrible.

From upstream:
I took over a few years ago and am just one of many devs who have held this position in the past.

We don't object to you making your own forks and builds but we do object to people being selfish, which is why we specify No Derivative Works.
If you want to modify the code to add some nice feature the least you can do is ask and submit a pull request to allow everyone to benefit from it.
